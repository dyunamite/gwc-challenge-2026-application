Code for our application to the GWC Cybersecurity and AI Challenge 2026. Here's a description of our project
Our project, Art Against AI, is a website that offers and attaches unique AI generated watermarks that are applicable for user uploaded visual art, music, and literature. For visual art, the AI identifies three potential regions of negative space and overlays a transparent, organic watermark. It allows the user to select and download the watermarked image of their preference. For music, the program accepts a music file, generates, and adds two seconds of static / white noise during silent periods within a song. For written pieces, the program inserts zero width space and non joiner characters in between morpheme boundaries in words. These processes mark the different forms of art with digitally detectable watermarks that do not significantly impact the overall look or output of the media. By combining AI based analysis of digital media with user guided decisions, we have formed a safe and reliable platform that artists can use to protect and preserve their intellectual property.
